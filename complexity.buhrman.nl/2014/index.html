<h2>Homework and exam</h2>
<p>
Exercises will be handed out every week, they should be handed in at the start of the Monday lecture of the next week. The solutions should
either be handed in by paper (handwritten is fine), or sent by email to Florian.
You are allowed to cooperate, but everyone has to write down their solution in their own words. 
When computing the average grade for the exercises, the lowest score will be dropped.
</p>
<p>
Besides the exercises there will also be a final exam on May 26th. The exam will be <strong>open book</strong>, which means you are allowed
to bring the book and any notes you made - digital equipment is not allowed.
The final grade for the course will be the calculated as the average between the grade for the exercises
and the final exam.
</p>
<p>Previous year's exam is <a href="old exam.pdf">available online</a>. Don't forget
that the exact topics tested (and exam size) will not necessarily be the same this year!</p>
